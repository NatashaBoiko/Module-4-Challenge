# Module-4-Challenge

## Overview of Project
In this project I had to rework part of the analysis by using a new dataset. I checked for missing values, duplicate rows to make sure we recieve the correct output.

### Purpose
The main purpose to clean the data using the functions we learned in the module and summarize information needed.

## Results
-I created a summary statistics for the student DataFrame to provide the summarized information about the collected data.
-Found the average budget for each school type by using the functions:"groupby" and "mean".
-Found the total number of students for each school and sorted to make it easier to understand.
-Found the average scores to see which students are more successful and areas to work on.
